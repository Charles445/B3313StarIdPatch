# B3313 Star Id Patch (for 0.9)
 Unofficial, hastily thrown together patch for star IDs in B3313 (0.9)

Tries to make as many stars as possible unique (except for real red stars).  
Assigns ~370 IDs, and makes a few ASM changes.

#### How to Use
Apply the .bps patch from the 'patch' folder to a copy of B3313 (0.9)

##### Caution!
This is **NOT** compatible with your old save file!  
This is also not a complete fix: there are plenty of stars left unchanged, and some of these assigned stars might be inaccessible.  
The patch might also introduce new bugs...  
Use at your own risk! (I hope I didn't break any red stars...)

*If you want a complete experience, I highly recommend waiting for the official 1.0 / 2.0 release instead!*  
  
#### Changes
370+ Assigned star IDs

Red stars now factor into your star count. Might as well...

MIPS the rabbit is now course specific, so there are a couple more stars to collect than usual.
You also can't 'miss' finding him like you could in 0.7  
If any devs are reading this, please do this in the actual release! I worry about the rabbit too much.

I turned off a B3313 specific function that sets star IDs so I could do it myself.  
I don't think that's going to break anything, but it might!  
It probably won't...


##### Notes
I might update this later with more assigned star IDs if I have the time.  
I cannot guarantee that your save file using this patch will be compatible with the update, however.
